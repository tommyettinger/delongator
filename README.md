Is your math using too much long all the time?

Is your GWT always plodding around, driving you crazy?!

Is long math tearing up your performances?

Think there's no answer?

You're so stupid!

There is!

**Delongator.**

Finally, there's a performant, portable number dirty hack!

# Get

Depends on libGDX 1.12.1 ! Rips it apart with tooth and claw!
This should be available by at least JitPack soon! Because this
is for GWT, you will need a `:sources` dependency! If this doesn't
make any sense to you, you probably don't need this library!
